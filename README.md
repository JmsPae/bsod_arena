# BSOD Arena
A 2D arena shooter where if you die, you bluescreen.

## Platforms
Currently, only Windows and Linux as supported by the `bsod` crate.

The Linux version, however, is not quite as immersive.

# *OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER*
Whilst this *shouldn't* ruin your PC, *whowever*...

I am in no way responsible if you get skill-issued and the BSOD causes any physical or psychological damage.

You *really* should be running this in a VM.
